Full source code available on Github.

This was my first time working with machine learning on this scale and my first time ever working with reinforcement learning. The source code is extremely disorganized due to the trial and error I needed to learn how to use ML-Agents, tensorboard, etc. 
To organize things in the Github repo, I've zipped the source code into the file "465-Project" and uploaded the three builds of the game used in the user study into the files "ManualControl" "AutomatedControl" and "AdaptiveControl"
For convenience, the "Scripts" directory in the root of the repo has the same scripts that are in the Assets folder in the zip of the source code. 

Successful completion of the game requires the player entering a code, once the correct code is entered it will print to the console. The code can be changed in the KeypadManagr.cs script by changing the correctCode string.
